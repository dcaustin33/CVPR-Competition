# CVPR-Competition

Code for the competition on vehicle detection through haze from drone imagery. More info can be found http://cvpr2022.ug2challenge.org/dataset22_t1.html.

Utlized FFA Net (SOTA dehazing architecture) in order to dehaze images which then fed to a Faster RCNN in order to classify and produce bounding boxes.

FFA net is publicly available thanks to the authors at https://github.com/zhilin007/FFA-Net.
